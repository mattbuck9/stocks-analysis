# stocks-analysis
## Overview
### The goal of this project is to analyse the stock market to determine the profitabiltiy of various stocks.

## Results
### Well, in my case, the results did not match the goals, as I really struggle with VBA. The ideal results is to find that 2017 was a much better year than 2018, and that only two stcoks (ENPH & RUN) had positive returns in 2018. Unfortunately, that didn't work for me! I keep running into errors, no matter what I try. 

## Summary
### The benefit of VBA and code like this is quite high. In the professional world, Excel is one of the most commonly used tools. Adding coding to make it go further while still being user friendly is extremely important. However, the drawbacks are VBA is one of the more complicated languages I've seen to date, as it doesn't work similar to Python or JS, so much as I can see anyways. Additionally, the analysis is limited to what can be contained within an XLSM file, whereas other languages and databases can conduct much more data analysis faster.
